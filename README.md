# 🎼 TTML Lyrics Collection (Personal Archive)

This repository contains a curated collection of **TTML (Timed Text Markup Language) lyric files**, manually timed and formatted by me.  
The primary purpose of this repo is **archival, experimentation, and integration** with personal tooling and projects (such as lyric players, subtitle engines, custom websites, etc.).

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This repository is not intended for redistribution of copyrighted lyric text. All lyrics remain the property of their respective rights holders. These files are archived here strictly for personal research, development, and non-commercial use.
